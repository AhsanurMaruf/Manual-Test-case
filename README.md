# Write Test Cases for Any Known Application

This repository serves as a guide for understanding test automation, writing effective test cases, and exploring the types and principles of software testing. It is designed for Quality Assurance (QA) professionals and testers to ensure software applications meet user requirements and function as intended.

## Introduction to Test Automation

**Test automation** uses tools and scripts to automatically execute and validate tests. It improves the efficiency and accuracy of the testing process while reducing manual effort. Commonly used tools include:

- **Selenium**: Ideal for web application testing.  
- **Appium**: Used for mobile app testing on various platforms.  
- **JMeter**: Performs performance and load testing.

## Seven Testing Principles

1. **Testing Shows the Presence of Defects**: Testing reveals defects but cannot guarantee an error-free system.  
2. **Exhaustive Testing is Impossible**: Focus on risk-based testing rather than testing all possible scenarios.  
3. **Early Testing**: Detecting defects early in development reduces costs and effort.  
4. **Defect Clustering**: Most defects are concentrated in a small number of modules.  
5. **Pesticide Paradox**: Regularly review and update test cases to uncover new defects.  
6. **Testing is Context-Dependent**: Tailor your testing approach to the specific application.  
7. **Absence of Errors Fallacy**: An error-free system doesn’t guarantee it meets user needs.

## What is a Test Case?

A **test case** is a set of instructions to validate software functionality under specific conditions. It includes preconditions, inputs, actions, expected results, and postconditions. Test cases ensure software behaves as intended in normal, abnormal, and error conditions.

---

## Test Case vs. Test Scenario

- **Test Case**: Focuses on specific details of "how" the application should behave (e.g., validating an error for an incorrect email).  
- **Test Scenario**: Represents broader user tasks or conditions (e.g., successfully logging in).

## Types of Test Cases

1. **Functionality Test Cases**: Ensure each feature works as intended.  
2. **Performance Test Cases**: Validate speed, scalability, and stability.  
3. **Unit Test Cases**: Test individual components, modules, or functions.  
4. **UI Test Cases**: Check UI elements for usability and correctness.  
5. **Security Test Cases**: Ensure security, privacy, and data integrity.  
6. **Integration Test Cases**: Verify the seamless integration of components.  
7. **Database Test Cases**: Test database functionality and compliance.  
8. **Usability Test Cases**: Validate user-friendliness and ease of navigation.  
9. **User Acceptance Test Cases**: Confirm the application meets business requirements.  
10. **Regression Test Cases**: Ensure recent changes don’t affect existing functionality.

## Standard Test Case Format

1. **Test Case ID**  
2. **Test Scenario**  
3. **Test Steps**  
4. **Prerequisites**  
5. **Test Data**  
6. **Expected Results**  
7. **Actual Results**  
8. **Test Status (Pass/Fail)**

## Reusable Test Case Templates

A reusable template ensures consistency and covers all critical elements. Many testers prefer spreadsheets with one test case per row and test elements in columns.

---

## Tools for Test Automation

1. **Selenium**: For web automation testing.  
2. **Appium**: For mobile app automation testing.  
3. **JMeter**: For performance and load testing.
